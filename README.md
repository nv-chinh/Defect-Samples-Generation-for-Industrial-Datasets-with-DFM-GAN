# Defect Samples Generation for Industrial Datasets with DFM-GAN

## 🔍 Introduction
Industrial defect inspection plays a critical role in ensuring manufacturing quality, reliability, and safety. However, real defect samples are often scarce in production environments, which severely limits the performance of deep learning models that depend on large and diverse training samples to learn the general and varied features of defects. To address this challenge, this project implements **DFM-GAN** (Defect-aware Feature Manipulation GAN) - a few-shot image generation approach that synthesizes realistic and diverse defect images from only a few real defect samples. Unlike previous traditional methods that learn how to generate entire defective samples, **DFM-GAN** manipulates only localized defect regions while preserving the structural integrity of the remaining parts of the object . This strategy approach allows the model to learn defect patterns efficiently without requiring large datasets.
